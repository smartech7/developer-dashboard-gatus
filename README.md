A service health dashboard in Go that is meant to be used as a docker 
image with a custom configuration file.

Live example: https://status.twinnation.org/


## Usage

By default, the configuration file is expected to be at `config/config.yaml`.

You can specify a custom path by setting the `GATUS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

```yaml
metrics: true         # Whether to expose metrics at /metrics
services:
  - name: twinnation  # Name of your service, can be anything
    url: https://twinnation.org/health
    interval: 15s     # Duration to wait between every status check (default: 10s)
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"         # Status must be 200
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"   # Response time must be under 300ms
  - name: github
    url: https://api.github.com/healthz
    interval: 2m
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
  - name: Example
    url: https://example.org/
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

Note that you can also add environment variables in the your configuration file (i.e. `$DOMAIN`, `${DOMAIN}`)
